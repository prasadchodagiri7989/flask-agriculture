# Plant Type Predictor

The Plant Type Predictor is a Flask web application designed to assist in agricultural planning and gardening by predicting the most suitable plant types for specific soil conditions. Utilizing inputs such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels, pH, humidity, and rainfall, our model provides instant predictions to help you make informed decisions about what to plant in your soil.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Model Regression

The KNeighborsClassifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, such as predicting the class or category of a given input based on its features. It's part of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) family of algorithms.
- The KNeighborsClassifier algorithm works on the principle of finding the k-nearest neighbors of a data point based on some distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
- When you give it a new data point to classify, it looks at the k nearest data points in the training dataset and assigns the class label based on the majority class among those neighbors.
