# Plant Type Predictor

The Plant Type Predictor is a Flask web application designed to assist in agricultural planning and gardening by predicting the most suitable plant types for specific soil conditions. Utilizing inputs such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels, pH, humidity, and rainfall, our model provides instant predictions to help you make informed decisions about what to plant in your soil.
